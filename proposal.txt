My idea is to make a program to automate different dice rolls. Users will type expression
such as "2d6" and it will print out the results of rolling the dice. I hope to allow for all 
sorts of different modifiers and types of rolls, similar to what you might find in Dungeons
and Dragons or similar games. It will also allow for storing stats to be used in the rolls as well.

Easy: For the base level implementation, I will focus on getting just the main dice rolling down. 
Allowing for simple expressions such as "d20" or "3d6" and handling those. Once the basics of rolling
is down it will be easier to add on things such as modifiers and advantage.

Medium: Once basic rolling is down, my next goal is to add stat tracking and modifiers or allow for 
static modifiers on the rolls. Users will be able to set their strenght, dexterity, etc and then use 
those in rolls such as "d20 + str" or simply roll a str check with "str". This will probably use State 
to keep track of the stats. As part of this level I will also the ability to do simple modifiers as 
well such as "d8 + 2". 

Challenge: After all the main implementations are done. I will add all the other types of rolls you might 
encounter. Things like advantage/disadvatage, roll x keep/drop y, comibining different types of dice, etc. 
The goal will essentially be to add as much different functionality as I can to allow for anything a user
might want to roll for.
